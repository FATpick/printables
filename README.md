## Blank Tablature Templates

Tablature is an alternative to the traditional staff-notation representation of music that is especially well-suited for stringed instruments.

![](https://www.fatpick.com/ca/c-maj-guitar-tab-630x139.png)

Each line in a tablature score represents a string on the guitar. Notes in the song are represented by numbers indicating which fret and string should used to play the note.

```
e|--------------------------------------|
B|--------------------------------------|
G|--------------------------------------|
D|-------------------------7---9---10---|
A|------------7---8---10----------------|
E|---8---10-----------------------------|
```

We've prepared blank tab templates in wide variety of formats that you can print
out and use to transcribe songs by ear, when "translating" a song from traditional sheet music, when transcribing parts to a new instrument or a new tuning or when working out your own compositions.

These templates are also available from the [Guitar and Bass Tablature Templates](https:/www.fatpick.com/printables/blank-tabs) page at FATpick.com.

## Pentatonic Scale Poster for Bass Guitar

The pentatonic scale is a five-note subset of the major scale that is often heard in the bass-line of rock, jazz, and blues songs. The scale can broken down into five overlapping “box patterns” — each containing all of the notes of the scale. Each pattern connects to the one after it. By linking the patterns you can play the scale up and down the entire fretboard.
